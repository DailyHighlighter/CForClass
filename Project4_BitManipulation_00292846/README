I was able to get part 1 and 2 done. 
But could not for the life of me could I manage to make the 
bitmap system work, at all.

So this is what I Have.
lots of little text files.

the most important are in the main_area folder:
-  Main.c
-  Makefile
-  bitmap.c
-  bitmap.h


For Part 1, execute main.exe with the name of the file you want to encrypt, and specify the output file name, 
and select option 1.

For Part 2, execute main.exe with the names of the two files you want to combine,
say, Piece1.txt and Piece2.txt, and then specify the output file, say, Piece3.txt and select option 2.
