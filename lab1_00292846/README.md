## README
- Ben Martin 
- CIS205 Lab1
- my own assignment

The progam prompts a user for their name and greets them with it.

## Compile instructions 

To compile the program type the following in the terminal 

```
make
```
To run the program, type the following in the terminal
```
./lab1.c
``` 

## Completion Statement
I have attempted to make a file which asks for a user's first name, 
and then repeats it back to them. The stackoverflow forum post is used because i needed a way to figure out how to even make a string work.
